These are scripts for cleaning the MOH data, extracting sentences, and building distributional semantic files.

 - cleaner removes most punctuation, identifies sentences, attempts to eliminate junk sentences, and returns a file
   where each line is a lower case sentence;
   
 - modeller takes the file output by cleaner and generates a concordance (subsequently used for building word indices), a folder
   containing word-vector files, and a folder containing co-occurrence dimensions files (so a transposed version of the word-
   vector files);
 
 - prober projects context specific subspcaes based on input words and explores the situation of all word-vectors in the 
   vocabulary in this space;
 
 - wtver builds models based on the word2vec techniques, using the gensim package;
 
 - wtouter explores these spaces based on sets of input words.

Please check to make sure pathnames in these files will work for your own file structure!
